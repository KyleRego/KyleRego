# Hi, my name is Kyle Rego

I am a web developer currently working mostly with Ruby on Rails. Before I got into software development, I worked a few years combined on an ambulance and as a medical scribe before going to and leaving medical school. Prior to that, I got my BS in Physics from RPI in Troy, New York. Some of my hobbies include reading, listening to audiobooks, exercising, and trying to learn Japanese.

- [KyleRego/KyleRego.github.io](https://github.com/KyleRego/KyleRego.github.io) and [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss) have the assets of my personal website.

- [Anki magnifying glass mouse cursor](https://github.com/KyleRego/anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor) and [Anki enumeration tool](https://github.com/KyleRego/anki_enumeration_tool) are Anki add-ons I developed while I was in medical school.

- [Anki Record](https://github.com/KyleRego/anki_record) is a Ruby gem I am working on to use in a future Rails application.
