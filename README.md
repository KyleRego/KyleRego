# Hi, my name is Kyle Rego

I am a software developer ðŸ™‚

At the moment I am applying to software developer/web developer jobs. I am open to working with any technology, but most of my experience is web development with Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and React.

## Overview of my GitHub repos

### Ruby
- [anki_books](https://github.com/KyleRego/anki_books) is a Ruby on Rails note-taking and flashcards app that generates flashcard deck files that import into Anki.
- [anki_record](https://github.com/KyleRego/anki_record) is a Ruby library I developed that is used by Anki Books to generate the .apkg flashcard deck files. Those files are compressed SQLite databases, so it provides a Ruby API that hides unzipping/zipping that file and the SQL involved in updating the contained databases.

### .NET
- [AnkiBooks](https://github.com/KyleRego/AnkiBooks) is a partial Blazor rewrite of `anki_books` that inspired a number of posts on my blog.
- [Gallery](https://github.com/KyleRego/Gallery) is a small Razor Pages project; it is a minimum viable product of an artist's website that allows them to log in and upload images.
- [Larder](https://github.com/KyleRego/Larder) is an ASP.NET Core and React project intended to be a food/ingredient/nutrition tracking app.
