# Hi, I am Kyle ðŸ”¬

I am a web developer who currently works with Ruby on Rails. Before I got into software development, I worked a few years combined on an ambulance and as a medical scribe before going to and leaving medical school. Prior to that, I got my BS in Physics from RPI in Troy, New York. Some of my hobbies include reading, listening to audiobooks, exercising, and trying to learn Japanese.
